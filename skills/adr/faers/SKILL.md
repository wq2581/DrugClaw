# FAERS Query Skill

Query adverse event reports from FDA's FAERS database. No API key required.

## API

| Function | Input | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `get_metadata()` | — | `{total, last_updated}` |
| `count_reactions(drug, top_n)` | single drug name | `[{term, count}, ...]` |
| `count_reactions_batch(drugs, top_n)` | list of drug names | `{drug: [{term, count}, ...]}` |
| `search_adverse_events(drug, limit)` | single drug name | raw openFDA response dict |
| `summarize_reactions(reactions, drug)` | reaction list + label | compact one-line text |

## Usage

See `if __name__ == "__main__"` block in `faers_query.py` for runnable examples covering: single drug query, batch query, metadata retrieval, raw report inspection, and LLM-friendly summary output.

## Notes

- Drug names should be uppercase (auto-converted internally).
- Input accepts a single string or a list of strings for batch queries.
- `summarize_reactions` produces compact `DRUG: reaction(count), ...` format suitable for LLM context.
- Source: openFDA Drug Adverse Events endpoint (`https://api.fda.gov/drug/event.json`).

## CLI Usage (Fallback)

When vibe coding fails, run the script directly from the command line:

```bash
python skillexamples/03_FAERS.py <entity1> [entity2] ...
```

**Example:**
```bash
python skillexamples/03_FAERS.py aspirin ibuprofen
```

The script prints summarised, LLM-readable results to stdout. Without arguments, it runs built-in demo examples.
