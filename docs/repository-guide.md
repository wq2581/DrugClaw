# Repository Guide

## Start Here

If you are new to DrugClaw, read `README.md` first and use the CLI from the repository root:

```bash
python -m drugclaw doctor
python -m drugclaw run --query "What are the known drug targets of imatinib?"
python -m drugclaw list
```

## Top-Level Directories

### `drugclaw/`

The runtime package. This is the main place to look for the CLI, config handling, retrieval flow, and agent orchestration.

### `skills/`

Implemented skill code grouped by drug task category.

### `maintainers/`

Maintainer-oriented smoke scripts, helper utilities, and archived reference assets. These are useful during local development but are not part of the default product surface or the default `pytest` gate.

### `resources_metadata/`

Tracked minimal subtree that keeps the CLI, demos, and tests runnable right after `git clone`. This directory is the starting point for contributors and automated checks.

The full resource overlay bundle lives on the project's [Hugging Face mirror](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Mike2481/DrugClaw_resources_data). Extracting that tarball at the repository root overlays additional files on top of `resources_metadata/` to unlock broader `LOCAL_FILE` coverage. Maintainers can inspect the builder and validator under `maintainers/resources/`.

### `support/`

Project images and visual assets used in the README and related docs.

## Runtime Surface vs Support Material

The main runtime surface is:

- `drugclaw/`
- `python -m drugclaw ...`
- `drugclaw ...` after editable install

Support material includes:

- `maintainers/`
- `docs/`

## Contributor Orientation

If you are debugging the package behavior, start in `drugclaw/`.

If you are checking whether a skill is implemented or data-backed, look in `skills/` and `resources_metadata/`.

If you are validating a specific resource path or maintainer utility, check `skills/` and `maintainers/`.

If you need machine-local scratch scripts, notes, or throwaway dev helpers, keep them under `.devlocal/` so they stay out of version control.
